This is the repository that contains the code for The MyReads app.
This app is built as the out of class project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program.

## TL;DR

To Use the app Locally:

* open your project folder and open CLI there 
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the app with `npm start`
